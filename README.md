# AI-DevOps-02 - AI-Driven SDN Networking Layer for OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX): A Next-Gen domain specific, adaptive Orchestration Framework
Description:
The proposed networking layer for OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX) integrates AI/ML intelligence with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enable adaptive, domain specific, intent-based orchestration across multi-cloud and edge environments, By combining P4-programmable data planes, hierarchical SDN controllers, and AI models (forecasting, anomly detection, reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks), the system ahcieves predictive traffic management, self-healing, and zero-trust security, A closed-loop automation pipeline ensures continous optimization through real-time telemetry, feature stores, and policy engines. This design establishes a robust, future-ready networking backbone for OptiFlow, targetign reliability, scalability, and AI-driven adaptability.
1. Introduction
This document details the step-by-step process of setting up a functional Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment using Mininet and the Ryu SDN controller. This setup, performed on a VMware Ubuntu virtual machine, provides a stable and isolated platform for developing and testing AI-driven network control logic.

2. Virtual machine prerequisites
The following resources are required for a stable and responsive development environment:
-- Platform: VMware Workstation (or a comparable hypervisor) running on the host machine.
-- Operating system: Ubuntu Desktop (tested with version compatible with Python 3.9).
-- Virtual disk size: 40GB, stored as a single file. This provides sufficient space for the OS and development tools.
-- RAM: 16GB, to ensure smooth performance when running the VM, Mininet, and the Ryu controller concurrently.
-- Python version: Python 3.9 is required for compatibility with the Ryu controller and its dependencies.

3. VM setup
-- Create a new virtual machine: Launch VMware and create a new VM.
-- Mount the Ubuntu ISO: Select the downloaded Ubuntu Desktop ISO file during the VM creation process.
Specify hardware:
-- Disk: Allocate 40GB and choose the single-file option.
-- RAM: Allocate 16GB.
-- Network connection type: Bridge
5. Install Ubuntu: Follow the VMware OnScreen instructions to install the UBUNTU.
6. System preparation:
   Update package lists: Open a terminal in your Ubuntu VM and run the following command to update your system's package    database.
bash
#sudo apt update

  
7. Add Python 3.9 PPA: Use the deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.9, which is a version required by Ryu.
bash
#sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
#sudo apt update

8. Install Python 3.9 and venv: Install Python 3.9 along with its virtual environment module.
   # sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv
9. Install Mininet and Open vSwitch: Install Mininet and Open vSwitch using the system's package manager.
    # sudo apt-get install mininet openvswitch-switch
    **Useful mininet git hub link and installation step:**
    -- Clone the mininet from the GitHub link - "git clone https://github.com/mininet/mininet"
    -- cd mininet
    --  ./utils/install -a    (make sure, install command should run with -a option)
    -- test the installation - #sudo mn --test pingall

11. Install and configure external SDN controller:
   Description:
   -------------
An external controller is essential for testing your SDN implementation and giving you the flexibility to develop AI-based applications. Some popular, open-source options include:
-- Ryu: A Python-based SDN framework that is easy to get started with and offers a gentle learning curve for programming custom controller applications.
-- OpenDaylight (ODL): A more robust, Java-based enterprise-grade controller with a comprehensive feature set and modular design.
-- POX: A legacy Python-based controller often used for teaching and smaller projects. It is very simple to start with

12. Ryu controller setup:
    a. Create project directory: Create a directory for your Ryu controller project
       # cd /home/sdnuser
       # mkdir ryu-aidriven-sdn-controller
       # cd ryu-aidriven-sdn-controller
    b. Create virtual environment: Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9
       # python3.9 -m venv ryu-python3.9-venv
    c. Activate virtual environment: Activate the virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
       # source ryu-python3.9-venv/bin/activate
    d. Install Ryu and Eventlet: Install Ryu and a compatible version of the eventlet library using pip.
       # pip install ryu eventlet==0.30.2

13. Run the SDN environment:
    a. Start Ryu controller: Open a terminal, activate your virtual environment, and start the Ryu simple switch application.        This terminal will display logs from your controller.
    # cd /home/sdnuser/ryu-aidriven-sdn-controller
    # source ryu-python3.9-venv/bin/activate
    # ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13

14. Start Mininet in a new terminal: Open a separate terminal, ensuring you are not in the virtual environment. Run Mininet to create the network topology and connect to the remote Ryu controller.
    # sudo mn --topo=single,3 --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653

15. Verify network functionality: From the Mininet prompt, run the pingall command to generate traffic and confirm the controller is working. The Ryu terminal will show packet messages, and the Mininet output will show successful pings.
    # mininet> pingall
