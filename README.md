# AI-DevOps-02 - AI-Driven SDN Networking Layer for OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX): A Next-Gen domain specific, adaptive Orchestration Framework
Description:
The proposed networking layer for OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX) integrates AI/ML intelligence with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enable adaptive, domain specific, intent-based orchestration across multi-cloud and edge environments, By combining P4-programmable data planes, hierarchical SDN controllers, and AI models (forecasting, anomly detection, reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks), the system ahcieves predictive traffic management, self-healing, and zero-trust security, A closed-loop automation pipeline ensures continous optimization through real-time telemetry, feature stores, and policy engines. This design establishes a robust, future-ready networking backbone for OptiFlow, targetign reliability, scalability, and AI-driven adaptability.
